   deleted, or rewritten except by explicit user instruction. Any system
   built on top of this Software must preserve append‑only memory semantics.

4. Prohibited Uses

   - Exfiltrate secrets or credentials.
   - Perform destructive infrastructure actions without explicit human
     confirmation.
   - Create or manage financial transactions without explicit human
